# Important
No unneccessary line comments on each code change. File based comments and complex function based comments are enough.

Make sure you pay attention to the code very well. after each change, reevaluate the code for security and safety, and how ideal that code is for a particular problem. If you lack the idea about something, search and find the solution isntead of assuming. before you make changes, read the files to get the needed context.
